* There are specific standards and conventions for defining class names in Python.

1) Class Names Should Be Capitalized: Class names should start with an uppercase letter, and the rest of the name should use camel case (i.e., words are separated by capitalizing the first letter of each word).

Example: MyClass, PersonInfo, CarModel

2) Use Descriptive and Clear Names: Pick names that make sense to other people who read your code and that accurately describe the goal of the class. Steer clear of class names that are too short or unclear.

Example: Give your class a more descriptive name, such as EmployeeDatabase, rather than calling it class A.

3) Avoid Using Underscores at the Beginning: While an underscore can be used to begin a class name, this is usually saved for unique situations such as internal or private classes. Keep your class names free of underscores at the beginning.

For illustration, use the reserved string _MyClass.

4) Avoid Using Python Keywords: Don't use Python keywords as class names. This can lead to confusion and errors.

Example: Avoid naming your class class, if, or for.

5) Follow PEP 8 Guidelines: PEP 8 is Python's official style guide. It recommends following the above rules and provides guidelines for writing clean and readable Python code.

6) Use Meaningful Singular Nouns: Class names should typically represent singular nouns (e.g., Car, Person, Account), as classes often represent individual objects or entities.
  
7) Consistency: Maintain consistency in your naming conventions throughout your codebase to make it easier for others to understand and work with your code.

8) Namespace Clashes: Be watchful of possible naming disputes. Make that the names of your classes don't conflict with those of any other modules, classes, or the Python standard library.
